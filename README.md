# Date-Rescue

Date Rescue is a dating safety app for anyone and everyone who wants to feel secure when entering the jungle of online dating.

As ubiquitous as dating apps like Tinder, OKCupid, and others have become, it is understandably nerve-wracking to schedule a meeting with a stranger. What if they've misrepresented themselves? What if they have ulterior motives? What if it's the most awkward experience of your entire life?

Date Rescue is here to help.

With Date Rescue, users can make "date profiles" with information about their upcoming rendez-vous, including date, time, location, customizable notes, and image. Once the date is saved, users are provided with a shareable link that they can then send to their friends so that their loved ones will know where they're at and who they're meeting. These links can be made inactive at any time, so you don't have to worry about your date's information sitting around in your friend's browser if you hit it off with your mysterious new beau (or if you just want to forget all about it). Forget to cancel your public date page? No worries, the link expires in 12 hours.

Best of all, Date Rescue allows users the option to schedule a "rescue call" at a time of their choice, offering a convenient excuse to ditch the date if you don't feel a spark. If you're enjoying yourself and don't need the convenient out, no worries! Just ignore the call. You can always reschedule it with a few clicks of a button.

Date Rescue's final feature is a Recommendations page with a list of user-recommended bars that they found perfect for that awkward first date. Find a bar in town that has good lighting and easy bathroom access? Create a recommendation on the app and let other users know! Recommendations will even show whether the venue offers "angel shots," a codeword that, when ordered, alerts the bar/restaurant staff that the customer is feeling uncomfortable and needs help getting out of their date.


# Future Development

- Customizable call-types that will allow users to choose what sort of rescue call they will receive.
- A comments section in the recommendations form so users can say what they love about the venue they're recommending.
- Location tracking so that the public date page will show the user's up-to-date location, adding another level of security.
